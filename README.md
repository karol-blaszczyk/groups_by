## Usage

There are several ways of using groups_by.

### Basic
  The first way is to go through the `GroupsBy` class itself.

  ```ruby
      require 'groups_by'

      GroupsBy.new.groups_by(
              <ARRAY_OF_HASHES>,
              group_by_rules: <GROUPING_RULES>)
      # => grouping result
  ```
### CoreExt
  The second way is to modify the Array class by including core extension.
  ```ruby
      require 'groups_by/core_ext/array'   # extends only Array

      [
        { name: '--2222--', age: '18-24', gender: 'Male', views: 1 },
        { name: '--1111--', age: '18-24', gender: 'Female', views: 2 },
        { name: '--2222--', age: '25-34', gender: 'Female', views: 1 },
        { name: '--1111--', age: '25-34', gender: 'Male', views: 1 }
      ].groups_by(:age, :gender, ->(el) { el[:name][/\d+/])
      # =>
      #  {
      #    '18-24' =>
      #      {
      #        'Male' => {
      #          '2222' => [{ name: '--2222--', age: '18-24', gender: 'Male', views: 1 }]
      #        },
      #        'Female' => {
      #          '1111' => [{ name: '--1111--', age: '18-24', gender: 'Female', views: 2 }]
      #        }
      #      },
      #    '25-34' =>
      #      {
      #        'Female' => {
      #          '2222' => [{ name: '--2222--', age: '25-34', gender: 'Female', views: 1 }]
      #        },
      #        'Male' => {
      #          '1111' => [{ name: '--1111--', age: '25-34', gender: 'Male', views: 1 }]
      #        }
      #      }
